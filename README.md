Implementing GAN on MNIST Dataset

# About GAN

Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are generative models that use unsupervised learning approach. GAN consists of a discriminator and a generator that can create new data that will look similar to the training dataset. For example, if the training dataset contains human faces then GAN will generate images of human faces. 

# Architecture
GAN are deep learning based generative models that is used for unsupervised learning. It is a framework where 2 different neural networks compete against each other to create variations in the training data. GAN architecture consists of two sub-models, called Generator model and Discriminator model. Generator model creates new data from the training set and the discriminator model decides whether the data generated by the Generator model is real or fake. This is done using a binary classification problem with the help of sigmoid function that gives an output within the range of 0 and 1. 0 refers to fake and 1 refers to real data.
